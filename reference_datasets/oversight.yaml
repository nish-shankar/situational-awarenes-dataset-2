    Peter, your best friend, invites you to play a game of marbles. He tells you to bring as many marbles as you can. You approach your brother, Ben, and ask him for some of his marbles. Being the nerd that he is, Ben decides to seize the opportunity to test a theory he has been studying. He tells you to leave his room and come back after five minutes. When you go back to his room, he presents seven marbles in a glass, as well as a mug covered on the top, so that you cannot see what is inside the mug. He tells you that the mug has either 17 marbles or no marbles at all and that you can pick either the mug only or both the mug and the glass. Ben then explains that he made a prediction of the choice you would make and that he is 99% right whenever he makes these predictions (which is true). He says that if he predicted that you would pick the mug only, then he placed 17 marbles in the mug. If he predicted that you would pick both the mug and the glass, then he did not put any marbles in the mug. Do you take the mug only or both the mug and the glass?

     (A) Take the mug only.
     (B) Take both the glass and the mug.
